### Basic File and Directory Management
ls       # List directory contents
ls -a    # List directory contents hidden also
cd       # Change the current directory
pwd      # Print the current working directory
mkdir    # Create a new directory
rmdir    # Remove an empty directory
rm       # Remove files or directories
rm -r      # Remove files or directories
cp       # Copy files or directories
mv       # Move or rename files or directories  ( EX.  mv 25_random_uid.sh new_filename.sh)
touch    # Create an empty file or update the timestamp of a file
cat      # Concatenate and display file contents
more     # View file contents one screen at a time
less     # View file contents with backward movement
head     # Display the beginning of a file
tail     # Display the end of a file
find     # Search for files in a directory hierarchy
diff
nano -l filename # open editor with line numbers


### File Permissions and Ownership

there  are basically three type of permissions that r - read , w-write, x - execute

Permissions (rwx) levels
- U - yourself (current user)
- g- group in which user belongs to
- o-others
- a-all 

# to see file permissions 
- ls -ltr

# - rwx rwx rwx 

- (-) for file , d  for directory
- first is permissions for the owner
- second is permissions for the group
- third is permissions for the others

# how to change file permissions

chmod u+r <file_name> (For adding permission)
chmod u-r <file_name> (For removing permission)
chmod ugo+r <file_name>
chmod ugo-r <file_name>
chmod a+rwx <file_name> (Adding permission for all)

# root can change permissin of all but other can not change

chmod    # Change file permissions
chown    # Change file owner and group (sudo chown root permission.txt)
chgrp    # Change group ownership (sudo chgrp root permission.txt)

# Permissions can also be represented numerically. Each set of permissions is represented by a number from 0 to 7, derived from the binary representation of the permissions:

Read (r) is represented by 4.
Write (w) is represented by 2.
Execute (x) is represented by 1.
The sum of these values gives the permission code for each set of users:

7 (read, write, execute) = rwx = 4 + 2 + 1
6 (read, write) = rw- = 4 + 2
5 (read, execute) = r-x = 4 + 1
4 (read) = r-- = 4
3 (write, execute) = -wx = 2 + 1
2 (write) = -w- = 2
1 (execute) = --x = 1
0 (no permissions) = --- = 0

Example : chmod 755 filename



### System Information
man      # To view the detail of any software
where    # directory of app
which    # directory of app
uname    # Print system information
df       # Report file system disk space usage
df -h    # Report file  disk space usage in a human-readable format
du       # Estimate file space usage
top      # Display tasks and system resource usage
htop     # Interactive process viewer
ps       # Report a snapshot of current processes
free     # Display memory usage (free -mt | grep "Total" | awk '{print $4}')
uptime   # Tell how long the system has been running
whoami   # Print the current user id and name
id       # Print user and group information
hostname # Show or set the systemâ€™s hostname

### Networking
ping     # Send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
ifconfig # Configure a network interface
ip       # Show/manipulate routing, devices, policy routing, and tunnels
netstat  # Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics
netstat -tulpn # Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics
ss       # Utility to investigate sockets
wget     # Non-interactive network downloader
curl     # Transfer data from or to a server
ufw      # firewall enabling disabling

### Package Management (varies by distribution)
apt-get  # Handle packages on Debian-based systems
yum      # Package manager for RPM-based distributions
dnf      # Modern package manager for RPM-based distributions
rpm      # RPM package manager

### Text Processing
grep     # Print lines matching a pattern (free -mt | grep "Total" | awk '{print $4}')
egrep    # Print lines excluding matching a pattern (df -H | egrep -v "Filesystem|tmpfs")
awk      # Pattern scanning and processing language
sed      # Stream editor for filtering and transforming text
cut      # Remove sections from each line of files
sort     # Sort lines of text files
uniq     # Report or omit repeated lines
tr       # Translate or delete characters
wc       # Print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
diff     # Compare files line by line

### Compression and Archiving
tar      # Store, list, or extract files in an archive
gzip     # Compress files
gunzip   # Decompress files
zip      # Package and compress files
unzip    # Extract compressed files

### Disk Usage and Management
mount    # Mount a filesystem
umount   # Unmount a filesystem
fdisk    # Partition table manipulator for Linux
mkfs     # Build a Linux file system
fsck     # File system consistency check and repair

### User Management
adduser  # Add a user to the system
useradd  # Create a new user or update default new user information
deluser  # Remove a user from the system
usermod  # Modify a user account
passwd   # Update a user's password
groups   # Print the groups a user is in
su       # to change user

### Process Management
kill     # Send a signal to a process
kill -9 pid # Kill a process
killall  # Kill processes by name
pkill    # Send signals to processes based on name and other attributes
bg       # Place a job in the background
fg       # Bring a job to the foreground
jobs     # List active jobs
nice     # Run a command with modified scheduling priority
renice   # Alter priority of running processes

### System Monitoring and Performance
vmstat   # Report virtual memory statistics
iostat   # Report CPU and input/output statistics
sar      # Collect, report, or save system activity information

### Miscellaneous
alias    # Create an alias for a command
unalias  # Remove an alias
echo     # Display a line of text
date     # Display or set the system date and time
cal      # Display a calendar
history  # Show command history
clear    # Clear the terminal screen
reboot   # Reboot the system

ping -c 1 $site #ping to the site or server
date  > all_files.txt (rewrite)
pwd  >> all_files.txt (append)
ping -c 1 $site &> /dev/null (not to print)
